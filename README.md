The project “Enercon Wind Farms in Karnataka Bundled Project” in Gadag district in the State of
Karnataka. The project activity involves WIND WORLD WIND FARMS(KARNATAKA) PVT LTD
(3.2MW) & WIND WORLD WIND FARMS(KRISHNA) PVT LTD (15MW) supply, erection,
commissioning and operation of 29 machines of rated capacity 800 kW (Karnataka) & 600kW (Krishna)
each. The machines are Enercon E-40 & E-48 make. The project is owned by Wind World Wind Farms
PVT LTD (hereinafter referred to as the Project Proponent or PP).
The details of the registered project are as follows:

Purpose of the project activity:
Wind World Wind Farms PVT LTD has installed 18.2 MW wind farm in the state of Karnataka in India.
Wind World (India) Limited (“Wind World”) is the equipment supplier and the operations and
maintenance contractor for the Project. There are 29 Wind Energy Convertors (“WEC’s”) of with rated
capacity 800 kW & 600kW each. The generated electricity is supplied to Electricity Distribution
Company (DISCOM) under a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA). The expected operational
lifetime of the project is for 20 years. The project being a renewable energy generation activity, leads to
reduction in fossil fuel dominated electricity generation from the Indian grid.

The first WEC under the project activity was commissioned on 15/03/2005 and the last WEC
under the project activity was commissioned on 26/03/2005.The project has been operational
since the earliest commissioning date. The project activity is registered under Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)2 project with
registration number 1286. The crediting period of this project under CDM was 01/07/2010 –
30/06/2020. PP seeks verification under UCR from 01/07/2020 onwards, i.e., crediting period for
UCR starts from 01/07/2020 to 31/12/2024. Hence, there is no double counting for the said
project. The project consists of 29 turbines of Enercon make E-40 (25 * 600 KW) and E-48 (4 * 800 KW)
type Wind Energy Converters (WECs).

The purpose of the project activity is to generate emission free and environment friendly electricity
from the wind energy potential available in the region. The project is expected to generate and supply
33,481 MWh of electricity annually to the Indian grid. The project thus addresses the demand–supply
gap in the state of Karnataka and will assist the sustainable growth, conservation of resources and
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by using renewable energy source like wind energy. The project
activity will contribute towards reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from the atmosphere,
which has been estimated to be approximately 27,260 tCO2e per year, by displacing an equivalent
amount of electricity generation through the operation of existing fuel mix in the grid comprising
mainly of fossil fuel-based power plants. Thus, the project does not only reduce the demand-supply gap
of the respective grid, but also helps in reducing other pollutants like SOx, NOx, etc. from the
atmosphere. In the absence of the project activity the equivalent amount of electricity would have been
generated from the connected/ new power plants in the Indian grid, which are/ will be predominantly
based on fossil fuels.

This Bundled project activity consists of 29 Wind turbines, 4 no of 800kW & 25 no of 600kW
respectively manufactured and supplied by Enercon & Suzlon. This project Generate 18.2 MW
power which is consumed by customers delivered by the Grid. 

This is also the pre-project scenario. The technology employed for the project is well proven and safe.
Relevant dates for the project activity (e.g. construction, commissioning, continued operation periods,
etc.):
The WECs under the project activity were commissioned between 15/03/2005 and 26/03/2005
